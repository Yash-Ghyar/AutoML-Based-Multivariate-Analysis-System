🌐 Intelligent AutoML & Multivariate Analysis Platform

A next-generation Flask-based Machine Learning platform that automates data preprocessing, model training, and statistical analysis — designed for industry-grade AI applications with zero manual coding.

🧠 Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (No JS)

Backend: Flask (Python)

ML Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Seaborn, Matplotlib

🚀 Features

✅ Automatic Target Detection – No need to specify target manually
✅ Smart Model Selection – Compares ML algorithms and picks the best performer
✅ Dynamic Task Identification – Detects regression or classification automatically
✅ Complete Data Preprocessing – Handles missing data, encodes categoricals, scales numerics
✅ Multivariate Analysis Dashboard –

📊 Correlation Heatmap

🧩 PCA (Dimensionality Reduction)

📈 VIF (Feature Multicollinearity Check)
✅ Interactive Predictions – Enter data and get instant output
✅ Modern Bootstrap UI – Elegant, responsive, and business-ready

⚙️ How It Works

Upload your dataset (.csv)

App preprocesses and trains multiple ML models

Automatically selects the most accurate one

Generates correlation heatmap, PCA graph & VIF table

Predicts new outcomes in real time
